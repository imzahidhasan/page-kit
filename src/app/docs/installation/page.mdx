# Installation

Get started with **Berlix UI** in a few steps—whether you want to install via CLI or copy components directly from the docs. Here's the complete setup guide.

---

## 1. Set Up a React Framework

Start with any React-based framework like **Next.js**.

### Install Next.js with Create Next App

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

You'll see the following prompts:

```
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

### Start the App

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

---

## 2. Install Tailwind CSS

### Install Tailwind

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss @tailwindcss/cli
```

### Create a Global CSS File

**`app/globals.css`**

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme inline {
  --font-display: "Inter", "sans-serif";
  --color-primary-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
  --spacing: 0.25rem;
}
```

### Configure PostCSS

**`postcss.config.js`**

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
};
```

### Start Using Tailwind

**`app/page.tsx`**

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello world!</h1>;
}
```

---

## 3. Add Animation & Utility Dependencies

Berlix UI uses `motion`, `clsx`, and `tailwind-merge`.

```bash
npm install motion clsx tailwind-merge
```

### Add Utility Function

**`lib/utils.ts`**

```ts
import { ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

---

## 4. Install Berlix UI Components

### Option A: CLI Installation

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

Then install components:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://ui.rechesoares.com/registry/<component-name>.json"
```

Replace `<component-name>` with the component you want (e.g., `button`, `card`, `input`).

### Option B: Copy-Paste from Docs

If you prefer direct control, simply copy-paste the JSX/TSX code into your project.

This method gives you full flexibility and no dependency lock-in.
