# Installation

Getting started with **Page Kit** is simple. You don't need to install anything—just add component using cli or copy the component code you want and use it in your project. Here's how to set up your environment and start using Page Kit:

---

## 1. Set Up Your React Project

You can use any React-based framework. Choose one of the options below:

### Option A: Next.js (App Router)

#### Create a Next.js App

<CodeBlock code={`npx create-next-app@latest`} lang="bash" />

Follow the prompts to set up your project with the following options:

- When asked about TypeScript, select **Yes** or **No** based on your preference
- When asked about Tailwind CSS, select **Yes** (this will install and configure Tailwind for you)
- For the App Router, select **Yes**

#### Start Your App

<CodeBlock
  code={`
cd my-app
npm run dev
`}
  lang="bash"
/>

### Option B: Vite

#### Create a Vite App

<CodeBlock code={`npm create vite@latest`} lang="bash" />

Follow the prompts to set up your project with the following options:

<CodeBlock
  code={`│
◇  Project name:
│  my-app
│
◇  Select a framework:
│  React
│
◇  Select a variant:
│  TypeScript or JavaScript`}

lang="bash"
/>

#### Navigate to your project and install dependencies

<CodeBlock
  code={`
cd my-app
npm install
`}
  lang="bash"
/>

#### Start Your App

<CodeBlock code={`npm run dev`} lang="bash" />

## 2. Add Tailwind CSS

Page Kit components are built with Tailwind CSS. You'll need to add Tailwind to your project if it's not already included.

### For Next.js

If you selected Tailwind CSS during Next.js setup, it's already configured. Otherwise:

<CodeBlock
  code={`
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
`}
  lang="bash"
/>

Configure **`postcss.config.mjs`** file to include the Tailwind CSS plugin:

<CodeBlock code={`
const config = {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
  },
};

export default config;
      `}
    / >

Add Tailwind CSS to **`app/globals.css`** as shown below.:

<CodeBlock
  code={`
@import "tailwindcss";
      `}
  lang="css"
/>

That's it! Tailwind CSS is now set up in your Next.js project.

### For Vite

<CodeBlock
  code={`
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
`}
  lang="bash"
/>

Edit your **`vite.config.ts`**:

<CodeBlock
      code={`
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})}
`}
  lang="javascript"
/>

Add Tailwind CSS to **`app/globals.css`** as shown below.:

<CodeBlock
  code={`
@import "tailwindcss";
      `}
  lang="css"
/>

## 3. Copy Page Kit Components

Browse the Page Kit documentation and copy the JSX/TSX code for the component you want (e.g., Button, Input, Card).

Paste the code into your project's components folder.

You can customize the styles and props as needed.

---

## 4. Use the Component

Import the component into your pages or other components and start using it right away:

<CodeBlock
      code={`
import { Button } from "./components/ui/button";

export default function Home() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
}
  `}
  language="tsx"
/>

---

## Done

You're ready to build beautiful, modern UIs with **Page Kit**. No installation required—just copy, paste, and start building!
