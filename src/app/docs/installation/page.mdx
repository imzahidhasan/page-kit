# Installation

Getting started with **Page Kit** is simple. You don’t need to install anything—just copy the component code you want and use it in your project. Here’s how to set up your environment and start using Page Kit:

---

## 1. Set Up Your React Project

You can use any React-based framework, such as **Next.js**.

### Create a Next.js App

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project.

### Start Your App

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

---

## 2. Add Tailwind CSS (Optional)

Page Kit components work great with Tailwind CSS. If you want to use Tailwind, install it:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Add Tailwind to your CSS:

**`app/globals.css`**

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

---

## 3. Copy Page Kit Components

Browse the Page Kit documentation and copy the JSX/TSX code for the component you want (e.g., Button, Input, Card).

Paste the code into your project’s components folder.

You can customize the styles and props as needed.

---

## 4. Use the Component

Import the component into your pages or other components and start using it right away:

```tsx
import { Button } from "./components/button";

export default function Home() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
}
```

---

## Done

You’re ready to build beautiful, modern UIs with **Page Kit**. No installation required—just copy, paste, and start building!
