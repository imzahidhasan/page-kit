## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your contribution is already being worked on
2. **Create an issue** if you're planning a significant change
3. **Keep changes focused** - one feature or fix per pull request

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the project conventions

3. **Test your changes** locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new button variant"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve input focus issue"
   ```

## Adding New Components

When adding new components to Page Kit, follow these guidelines:

### 1. Create the Component

Place your component in the appropriate directory:

- **Core components**: `src/components/core/`

### 2. Component Structure

```tsx
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

interface YourComponentProps {
  // Define your props here
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}

const YourComponent = ({
  variant = "primary",
  className = "",
  children,
  ...props
}: YourComponentProps) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={cn(
        "base-styles",
        variant === "primary" ? "primary-styles" : "secondary-styles",
        className
      )}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default YourComponent;
```

### 3. Add Documentation

Create documentation for your component:

1. **Create a doc page**: `src/app/docs/your-component/page.mdx`
2. **Add component preview**: `src/app/docs/your-component/your-component-preview.tsx` (as many preview need make here)
3. **Update navigation**: Add your component to `src/constants/navigation.ts`

### 4. Component Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all components
- Support light and dark themes
- Make components responsive
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the existing naming conventions

## Documentation

### Writing Documentation

- Use clear and concise language
- Include code examples
- Add prop tables for components
- Provide usage examples
- Document any breaking changes

### MDX Files

Documentation is written in MDX format, which allows you to include React components in Markdown:

````mdx
# Component Name

Description of what the component does.

## Usage

```tsx
import YourComponent from "@/components/core/your-component";

<YourComponent variant="primary">Hello World</YourComponent>;
```
````

### Manual Testing

1. **Test your changes** in the development environment
2. **Check responsiveness** on different screen sizes
3. **Verify dark/light theme** compatibility
4. **Test accessibility** with keyboard navigation

### Build Testing

Before submitting, ensure your changes don't break the build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push your changes** to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:

   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what was changed and why
   - Screenshots/GIFs for visual changes
   - Reference to related issues

3. **Wait for review** and address any feedback

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and atomic
- Write clear commit messages
- Include tests if applicable
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure CI checks pass

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces for props
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add proper type annotations

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper prop drilling or context when needed

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use motion for any type of animation
- Follow the existing design system
- Support both light and dark themes
- Ensure responsive design

### Formatting

The project uses ESLint for code formatting. Run:

```bash
npm run lint
```
